    <p>My name is Samuel Shack Jr. I am a senior at Michigan State University and I am majoring in Information Science. I was born and raised in Detroit, Michigan and I am 21 years old. Music and sports are a big part of my life. Growing up, I always used to watch sports with my dad and grandpa. I first touched a basketball at 5 years old and knew instantly basketball would be my favorite sport. Music is the way to my soul. Any activity I am doing, I need music playing in my ears to get me through it. Music has and will continue to bring me closer to other people.</p>
